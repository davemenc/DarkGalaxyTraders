H1 DarkGalaxyTraders
DarkGalaxyTraders is a turn based computer game with an emphasis on exploration and trading. 

H2 What's Here
As of this writing, there are two versions. 

DarkGalaxyTraders is a text based game in python that features star systems connected by wormholes (that is, it's a graph based map). It's a complete game in the sense that it can be played to completion but it has no graphics (think 101 BASIC Games from days of yore). It primarily demonstrates a trading system but we'll get back to it anon.

DarkContinentTraders is a graphic turn base game that puts the player on a big landmass. His mission: find the cities, identify the bests commodities to trade and trade them until he hwas enough money to win. This game is incomplete in the sense that all you can do is wander around finding cities; it doesn't have the trading part yet. 

H2 Where This Is Going
The vision for the game is to have it be a multiplayer web based game. Beyond that, I want to have several different games that are all connected. 

When you get complete one game you go through a portal (which costs most of your money and other resources) and start over on another. 

The game you teleport to might be the same kind of game (a different continent and different players and commodities to trade) or it might be a something else (a space game or a completely different sort of game).

Eventually, it may be that other people create games that follow the same connection rules so now you can connect from my trading game to someone else's. 

H2 Contributing
I have a very simple notion of contributing. If you want to help with an existing game, by all means you can do a pull request. But if you want to go off in a completely different direction you can just copy the code you like into another directory (as I have done with DarkGalaxyTraders and DarkContinentTraders) and create a new game there. Since the goals is to hook all these games togehter eventually it will all be connected. 

H2 Licence
I use the Apache License which means that anything added to this repo stops being your property and becomes available to everyone. Very egalitarian but if you have hopes of one day being rich off your work, DO NOT CHECK IT IN HERE!
