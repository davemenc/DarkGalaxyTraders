# DarkGalaxyTraders
DarkGalaxyTraders is a turn based computer game with an emphasis on exploration and trading. 

## What's Here
As of this writing, there are two versions. 

*DarkGalaxyTraders* is a text based game in python that features star systems connected by wormholes (that is, it's a graph based map). It's a complete game in the sense that it can be played to completion but it has no graphics (think 101 BASIC Games from days of yore). It primarily demonstrates a trading system but we'll get back to it anon.

*DarkContinentTraders* is a graphic turn base game that puts the player on a big landmass. His mission: find the cities, identify the bests commodities to trade and trade them until he hwas enough money to win. This game is incomplete in the sense that all you can do is wander around finding cities; it doesn't have the trading part yet. 

## Where This Is Going
The vision for the game is to have it be a multiplayer web based game. Beyond that, I want to have several different games that are all connected. 

When you complete one game you may go through a portal (which costs most of your money and other resources) and start over on another. "Winning" in this model means "getting to go to the next game". 

The game you teleport to might be the same kind of game (a different continent and different players and commodities to trade) or it might be a something else (a space game or a completely different sort of game).

Eventually, it may be that other people create games that follow the same connection rules so now you can connect from my trading game to someone else's. 

## Contributing
Writing a game is a big project. This is a fairly simple game but it still has a lot of moving parts. I can imagine someone else being willing to do some of the work or add some cool embellishments. To do that, just do a pull request and we'll work it out.  

## Licence
I use the Apache License which means that anything added to this repo stops being your property and becomes available to everyone. Very egalitarian but if you have hopes of one day being rich off your work, DO NOT CHECK IT IN HERE!
